# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where you (the user) play against the computer. The game takes place on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to get three of your marks ('O') in a row, column, or diagonal.

## How It Works:
- You place your 'O' mark by choosing an available spot (1-9).
- The computer automatically places its 'X' mark after your move.
- The game checks for winners after each move and announces whether you win, lose, or tie.

## Features:
- Turn-based gameplay (user vs computer).
- Input validation to ensure the user selects an available spot.
- Victory detection for both the player and the computer.
- Displays the board after each move.

## How to Play:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `First_Python.py` file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your move by typing a number from 1 to 9.
4. The game ends when someone wins or the board is full (tie).
